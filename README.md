# SimpleFlow

Simple Flow was one of the cleanest, simplist, and best looking dark themes for KDE that still had a slight transparency.  Unfortunately is seems to have dissapeared from kde-look.  This is a copy from a previous installation so I can continue to use my favorite theme.

## Installation

In either the **/usr/share/plasma/desktopthemes/** (for global installs) or the  **~/.local/share/plasma/desktoptheme/** (for local installs) git clone this project.

Thanks
